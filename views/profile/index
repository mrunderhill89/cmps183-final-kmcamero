<h1>Browse Profiles</h1>
<p>Here you can browse the profiles of users who have chosen to make themselves public.</p>
<p>You can search for users with a specific name, skillset, or project that they're currently working on, 
as well as what groups they belong to. (For example, a group might consist of users who are currently
unemployed, or students who are in a particular class.)</p>
